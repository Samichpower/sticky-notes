# sticky-notes
Modular page for making notes. 

I want a basic navbar. Maybe links to a page explaining how to use the page? Another button to make a new note.

Each sticky note will have a buttons in the corner for:
  Deleting the note
  Clearing the notes content

Maybe have cool animations for all this?

Hurry through the page styling and layout, it will change as I learn how to make JS interact with it.
